## :crown: Community Guidelines

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

Please review our [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/wiefunkdai/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It is in effect at all times. We expect it to be honored by everyone who contributes to this project. Acting like an asshole will not be tolerated.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Thereâ€™s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.
If you have questions, see [Support](https://github.com/wiefunkdai/.github/blob/master/SUPPORT.md) file.

## :eyes: Finding Good, Filing Bugs and Change Requests

> *Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!*

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating
efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions
are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included docs.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the docs.
- **Formatting**: help keep docs easy to read with consistent formatting.

## :bulb: Asking Any Questions Support

See our [Support Guide](https://github.com/wiefunkdai/.github/blob/master/SUPPORT.md). In short, GitHub issues are not the appropriate place to debug your specific project, but should be reserved for filing bugs and feature requests.

## :wine_glass: Request for Changes / Pull Requests
You first need to create a fork of the [PhpWeddingCardBuilder](https://github.com/wiefunkdai/PhpWeddingCardBuilder) repository to commit your changes to it.
Methods to fork a repository can be found in the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

Then add your fork as a local project:

```sh
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/wiefunkdai/PhpWeddingCardBuilder.git

# Using SSH
git clone git@github.com:wiefunkdai/PhpWeddingCardBuilder.git
```

> [Which remote URL should be used ?](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories)

Then, go to your local folder

```sh
cd PhpWeddingCardBuilder
```

Add git remote controls :

```sh
# Using HTTPS
git remote add fork https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PhpWeddingCardBuilder.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/wiefunkdai/PhpWeddingCardBuilder.git


# Using SSH
git remote add fork git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/PhpWeddingCardBuilder.git
git remote add upstream git@github.com/wiefunkdai/PhpWeddingCardBuilder.git
```

You can now verify that you have your two git remotes:

```sh
git remote -v
```

### Receive remote updates
In view of staying up to date with the central repository :

```sh
git pull upstream master
```

### Choose a base branch
Before starting development, you need to know which branch to base your modifications/additions on. When in doubt, use master.

| Type of change                |           | Branches              |
| :------------------           |:---------:| ---------------------:|
| Documentation                 |           | `master`              |
| Bug fixes                     |           | `master`              |
| New features                  |           | `master`              |
| New issues models             |           | `YOUR-USERNAME:patch` |

```sh
# Switch to the desired branch
git switch master

# Pull down any upstream changes
git pull

# Create a new branch to work on
git switch --create patch/1234-name-issue
```

Commit your changes, then push the branch to your fork with `git push -u fork` and open a pull request on the [PhpWeddingCardBuilder](https://github.com/wiefunkdai/PhpWeddingCardBuilder/) repository following the template provided.
